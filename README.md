We have one file i.e **names.txt** which has list of different names . My goal is to predict the next character given a sequence of characters as an input.I have implemented different models from scratch using **PyTorch** library and with the help of some research papers to perform this Task.<br><br> Following are the models and techniques which I used for this task - <br><br>
**1) Bigram Model<br><br>
2) MLP(Multilayer Perceptron)<br><br>
3) Backpropagation**<br><br>





### Usage

The included `names.txt` dataset, as an example, has the most common 32K names takes from [ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/) for the year 2018. It looks like:

```
emma
olivia
ava
isabella
sophia
charlotte
...
```
