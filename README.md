# Makemore

makemore takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training thing, and generates more things like it. Under the hood, it is an autoregressive character-level language model, with a wide choice of models from bigrams all the way to MLP(multilayer perceptron). For example, we can feed it a database of names, and makemore will generate cool baby name ideas that all sound name-like, but are not already existing names. 


Current implementation follows a few key papers:

- Bigram (one character predicts the next one with a lookup table of counts)
- MLP, following [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)


### Usage

The included `names.txt` dataset, as an example, has the most common 32K names takes from [ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/) for the year 2018. It looks like:

```
emma
olivia
ava
isabella
sophia
charlotte
...
```
